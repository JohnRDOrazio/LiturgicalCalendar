# Liturgical Calendar
A PHP script that will generate the liturgical calendar for any given year, based on the General Roman Calendar, calculating the mobile festivities and the precedence of solemnities, feasts, memorials...
The idea is to turn this into a self-contained class that will allow for a number of operations, such as retrieving the liturgical information for a specific date or for a time period...
And so eventually I will separate the class from the view model...

Included is an SQL table dump **liturgy.sql** which contains fixed date festivities, memorials and optional memorials of the General Roman Calendar. The PHP script aids itself with these tables to generate the liturgical calendar. The table itself does not contain all fixed date solemnities since some of these are defined in the PHP script itself, nor does it contain movable feast which necessarily are calculated in the script.
