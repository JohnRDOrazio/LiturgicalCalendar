How you can contribute to this project:
* share your ideas by opening issues (either bug reports or feature requests)
* issue or contribute to a pull request that addresses a specific issue that has been acknowledged
* please make sure that the pull request is small, simple, direct and to the point, that it addresses the specific issue at hand with a concrete solution
* pull requests should generally be made against the `development` branch, in order to be sure that they can be tested by the community before being pulled into the `master` branch
* the `master` branch should be clean, only tested PRs should be pulled into the `master` branch (usually passing through the `development` branch first and then pulled from there). Version releases are created off of the `master` branch directly.
* if a PR is more complex and is directed at adding a significant feature, a specific feature branch will first be created, then the PR should be issued against the feature branch, that way the feature can be fully tested by the community before being pulled into the `master` branch
